Deployed using Vercel: https://game-hub-git-main-david-carrillos-projects-a6c64de5.vercel.app?_vercel_share=CJicCvirlSZG69T2HoWV8lpytKGc2RHF


*Created by:* **David Carrillo**
*for React 18 Beginner Course*


## Reason
The purpose of this project was to showcase the skills and knowledge learned and practiced during the React 18 beginner course, led by ***Mosh Hamedani***.
This application isn't for public use, but rather a demonstration of my (David Carrillo) ability to develop an application using basic React development.

## Application description
![Homepage](./public/Game%20Hub%20Main.gif)
The applicaiton created is a game discovery applicaiton using [RAWG](rawg.io)'s API to obtain the database of games. The user is able to explore the multiple games released across multiple mainstream platforms. Each game listed in the grid shows their name, compatible platforms, their critc rating, and an emoji indcating whether the game is **Meh** *(not good)* 😑, **Good** 👍🏽, or **excellent** 🎯. 


Users can alter the grid of games by using the filtering feature. 
The user can filter by Genre of games,

the platform they are released on,

or by keywords typed in the top search bar.

Users can also filter by using a combination of all three filter methods.

The User is also able to reorder the games in the grid by selecting one of the options in the drop-down menu: Relevance (default), Date added, Name, Release date, Popularity, or Average rating.

The application is also responsive to multiple aspect ratios, making it compatible across various devices (e.g., cell phones, tablets, and laptops), and includes a toggle switch for a dark/light mode.
